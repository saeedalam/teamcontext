TeamContext - Your Company's Technical Memory

TeamContext captures, preserves, and serves everything your team learns about
your codebase, architecture, and development history. It's the knowledge
layer that sits UNDER all AI tools.

Key Features:
  - Knowledge Graph: Connected decisions, warnings, patterns, files
  - Feature Contexts: Working memory with full lifecycle
  - Evolution Timeline: Track how knowledge changes over time
  - MCP Protocol: Works with any MCP-compatible AI tool
